LICENSE

Valve gave a license to use this code only to me. This license is not transferable, which means that, because I received this license, does not mean you can use this code as well - you must obtain a license from Valve directly.

The details of the license that I received shall not be disclosed here, as there is no need to do so.

There was no permission to share the source code of the SDK. This code is present here only as a necessity to compile the project.

All rights reserved by Valve. "Valve" is a registered trademark of Valve Corporation. I am not affiliated with or endorsed by Valve in any way.
