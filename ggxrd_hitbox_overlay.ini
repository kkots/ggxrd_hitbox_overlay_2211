; Specify true or false
; This controls whether a character being knocked down, waking up or air recovering causes the framebar to advance forward (if you're also idle).
; Framebar only advances forward when one or both players are not idle.
; Framebar advancing forward means it continuously overwrites its oldest contents with new data to display.
; This could be bad if you wanted to study why a combo dropped, as some knockdowns can be very long and erase all the info you wanted to see.
; Setting this to true may prevent that.
; The first frame when the opponent is in OTG state and onwards - those frames do not get included in the framebar.
; If you recover from your move later than the opponent enters OTG state, the frames are included for your whole recovery for both you and the opponent,
; which means OTG state may partially or fully get included into the framebar.
; In such cases, look for an animation start delimiter on the opponent's framebar, shown as a white ' between frames.
considerKnockdownWakeupAndAirtechIdle = false

; Specify true or false
; After waking up, or leaving blockstun or hitstun, or airteching, usually there's some strike and/or throw invul while
; you're idle and are able to fully act. Framebar only advances forward when one or both players are not idle, however,
; if this invul is present, then by default the framebar will advance anyway. You can set this setting to false to prevent that
; and consider being idle while having invul as still being idle.
considerIdleInvulIdle = false

; Specify true or false.
; Normally we consider standing as being idle, which does not advance the framebar forward.
; The framebar only advances when one of the players is "busy".
; If this is set to true, then as soon as you tell the dummy to play a recording slot, the entirety of the playback will be considered
; as "busy" and will advance the framebar, even if in parts of the recording the dummy is not doing anything.
considerDummyPlaybackNonIdle = true

; Specify true or false.
; If true, certain types of frames in the framebar will be displayed with distinct hatches on them.
; Make sure the framebar is scaled wide enough and the screen resolution is large enough that you can see the hatches properly.
; To scale the framebar you can drag its right edge.
